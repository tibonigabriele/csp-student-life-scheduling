        "\n",
        "After the first attempt to assign lunch slots, some days may not have available slots due to overlaps or domain limitations. In this section of the code, we attempt to find and assign lunch slots on the days that were not assigned during the first attempt. We use an approach that searches for the first 12 consecutive available slots that meet the time requirements for lunch.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Detailed Process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Identification of Available Slots**: For each unassigned day, identify all available slots that fall within the specified lunch time range and are still present in the reduced general domain.\n",
        "2. **Check for Consecutiveness**: Look for groups of 12 consecutive free slots that we can assign for lunch.\n",
        "3. **Assignment**: If we find a valid series of consecutive slots, assign them to V8 and update the reduced general domain to reflect this assignment.\n",
        "4. **Handling Failures**: If we do not find available consecutive slots, record the failure to assign slots for that specific day.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The updated results will be printed, including the removed slots, the updated reduced general domain, and the updated schedule.\n",
        "- Days for which we could not find and assign slots will be listed for further review or manual intervention."

        "\n",
        "In this part of the code, we calculate and assign slots for study (V10) during weekdays. The goal is to maximize the effective use of available time, taking into account the slots already occupied by other activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Process Description:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Calculation of Occupied Slots**: For each weekday, determine the number of slots already occupied by primary activities such as classes and meetings.\n",
        "2. **Calculation of Required Slots**: Subtract the occupied slots from the total available slots in a standard working day to determine the available slots for study.\n",
        "3. **Assignment of Slots**: Assign the available slots in blocks, aiming to distribute study time evenly throughout the week to ensure an appropriate workload distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Technical Details:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Study Time Blocks**: Define variable time blocks (18, 36, 54, 72) to accommodate different study needs.\n",
        "- **Checking and Assignment**: Verify the availability of consecutive slots and assign them to V10 if they fit the predefined blocks and do not exceed the total required slots.\n",
        "- **Handling Unassignable Slots**: If we do not find enough consecutive slots, track these for possible review or redistribution of activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The assigned study slots are displayed and updated in the reduced general domain.\n",
        "- Removed slots and days with assignments are printed to confirm the performed operations.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Process Description:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Definition of Time Blocks**: Set time blocks of 18 and 36 minutes as possible durations for study sessions.\n",
        "2. **Limitation of Slots per Day**: Establish a maximum limit of 36 slots per day to avoid overloading activities during rest days.\n",
        "3. **Assignment of Slots**: Through an iterative process, search and assign available slot blocks until the daily limit is reached, ensuring compliance with predefined time blocks and availability in the reduced general domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Technical Details:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Start and Stop of Assignment**: The process automatically stops once the maximum limit of slots per day is reached.\n",
        "- **Handling Available Slots**: Continuously check the availability of slots in the reduced domain and assign consecutive slots until the defined limits are reached.\n",
        "- **Reset and Counting**: During assignment, reset slot counters when encountering unavailable slots to maintain assignment consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The assignment results show how many slots were effectively assigned per day and update the global schedule.\n",
        "- Removed slots and changes to the general domain are printed to confirm the performed operations.\n",

        "This code segment is dedicated to assigning slots for shopping (V12), attempting to allocate blocks of 12 consecutive slots during available days. This procedure is crucial to ensure that shopping activities are scheduled efficiently without overlapping with other already planned activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Process Details:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Search for Available Blocks**: The code examines each defined interval for shopping for each day of the week, trying to find a continuous block of 12 free slots.\n",
        "2. **Conditional Assignment**: If a block of 12 consecutive slots is available, they are assigned for shopping, and the system marks these slots as occupied.\n",
        "3. **State Management**: If during the search a block is interrupted by an unavailable slot, the current block count resets and the search continues from the next slot.\n",
        "4. **Domain Selection**: The time intervals assigned for shopping are chosen based on hypothetical supermarket opening hours, ensuring that the selected slots correspond to the most convenient shopping periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Successful Assignment**: If a suitable block is found and assigned, a confirmation with the details of the start and end slot is printed.\n",
        "- **Failed Assignment**: If it is not possible to find a suitable block in any of the available intervals, an error message is printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach ensures that shopping slots are allocated efficiently, respecting the non-overlapping requirements and maintaining calendar consistency."

        "The following code defines a function for assigning slots for cleaning activities (`V13`). Considering the duration and frequency of required cleaning activities, blocks of 24 consecutive slots are chosen. The function attempts to assign these blocks on specific days and times based on the remaining availability in the general domain. The process follows these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Scan for Available Slots**: The function scans the defined time intervals for cleaning and searches for free blocks in the reduced domain.\n",
        "2. **Verification and Assignment**: If it finds a block of 24 consecutive available slots, it assigns these slots to the cleaning activity, updates the schedule, and removes the slots from the available domain.\n",
        "3. **Check and Feedback**: If it is not possible to assign a block on a specific day, the system records this limitation and provides feedback.\n",
        "4. **Domain Choice**: The time intervals assigned for cleaning activities are chosen based on the hours dictated by a hypothetical condominium regulation.\n",
